Hint: The GPS location functionality is integrated with Google Maps' GPS feature and necessitates that users have the Google Maps app installed on their devices. Moreover, the location function is tied to pre-existing region and language settings, designed to enhance usability and user experience. If the GPS is turned off, the default language setting is English, which does not interfere with the overall app functionality.<br>
